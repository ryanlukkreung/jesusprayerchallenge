<p>In June 2020, we started our second Jesus Prayer 40 cohort. This group helped to further flesh out what JP40 pilgrims were looking for and helped us to build up the necessary resources to help them.</p>

<p>Over the course of these six weeks, we had a series of fantastic discussions, whether in the Facebook group or during our Zoom calls. Our pilgrims from across Canada, the US, and even Thailand thoroughly enjoyed learning about and developing a deeper devotion to the Prayer of the Heart.</p>
