<h3>40 people, 40 Jesus Prayers for a day for 40 days</h3>

<p>Thank the Lord for putting it in your heart to answer this deeper call to prayer. </p>

<p>If you haven’t already, sign up for the next cohort by completing our contact form. This will allow us to organize the
group and give you regular catechesis on this amazing prayer.</p>

<p>Every week, pray 40 Jesus Prayers slowly, focusing on all the words. Take a picture of the rope/rosary/fingers you were using (not a picture of you praying) and post
it in the JP40 Facebook group at the end of the week, along with a short reflection about the
corresponding week’s theme.</p>

<p>Participate in the weekly ZOOM meeting to the best or your ability.</p>

<p>We are here to help and guide you. Within the challenge you will meet fellow pilgrims walking
this same path of the prayer, and Frs. Mike, Mykhailo and Warren are here to help guide you as
well. <strong>Reach out, we are here to help!</strong></p>

<h3>Why take this Challenge in the first place?</h3>

<p>Through this challenge you will develop a habit of praying the Jesus Prayer daily. This practice will deepen your relationship with the Lord and change your life forever. Through your weekly pictures/reflections you will fill cyberspace with an awareness of this amazing prayer and encourage your fellow participants. Finally, while you are praying the Jesus Prayer, we will be praying for you and preparing a traditional 33 knot Jesus Prayer rope (chotki) to be mailed out to you upon the completion of the 40 challenge days. We pray that this gift will be close at hand as you continue the habit of this beautiful prayer for the rest of your life!</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Do I need to be on Facebook to take this challenge?</strong></li>

    <p>Yes. This is a Facebook outreach and this platform allows us to establish a “cohort” of fellow pilgrims on the journey. If you need help setting up a Facebook account we would be more than willing to help you!</p>

  <li><strong>Can I participate without sharing a weekly picture/reflection?</strong></li>

    <p>Nope. The picture/reflection serve the purpose of a) helping to keep you focused and committed on the habit of prayer b) deepening your own experience and c) helping others along their journey. Without the sharing, your experience of the challenge would suffer.</p>

</ol>

<p><em>We hope that you will join us in this challenge, and we pray that through it we may truly “live a life of
peace and repentance” during this pandemic and well after. Glory be to Jesus Christ! Glory be forever!</em></p>
